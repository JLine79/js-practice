  <h1>This is an experimental page to practice JavaScript fundamentals and hopefully get better at it!</h1>

   <p>Exercises from <a href="https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-basic-exercises.php" target="_blank">W3 resource </a> </p>
   <p>1. Write a JavaScript program to display the current day and time in the following format.  
    Sample Output : Today is : Tuesday.
    Current time is : 10 PM : 30 : 38</p>

    <p id="exercise1"></p>

    <p> Things to remember about this!</p>
      <ul>Think through converting the hours to 12 hour instead of 24 hour</ul>
      <ul>This array method for selecting a number you don't know: let today = days[date.getDay()];</ul>
      <ul>You need a separate expression to tell midday from midnight or 12 noon will be 0!</ul>

    <p>2. Write a JavaScript program to print the contents of the current window.</p>

    <p id="exercise2"></p>

    <button onclick="window.print()">Print Me</button>

    <ul>You can add a built in method to the html and you don't even have to write a function for it, like this "button onclick="window.print()">Print Me button": </ul>

  <p>3. Write a JavaScript program to get the current date. Expected Output : mm-dd-yyyy, mm/dd/yyyy or dd-mm-yyyy, dd/mm/yyyy</p>

<p id="theDate"></p>

<ul>Remember the months are an array that starts with 0 so you have to add 1!</ul>

<p>4. Write a JavaScript program to find the area of a triangle where lengths of the three of its sides are 5, 6, 7.</p>

<p id="setLengths"></p>

<p>5. Write a JavaScript program to rotate the string 'w3resource' in right direction by periodically removing one letter from the end of the string and attaching it to the front. </p>

<p id="string">W3resource</p>

  <ul>The substring method is a good way to do this</ul>
  <ul>The animation effect is achieved with the setInterval method, each interval replaces the string with the rotated string</ul>

<p>6. Write a JavaScript program to determine whether a given year is a leap year in the Gregorian calendar.</p>

<input type "number" id="year" value="insert year">

<button onclick = "isLeapYear()">Check Leap Year</button>

<p id="answer">Enter a year and click 'Check Leap Year'</p>

  <ul>add ".value" onto the end of your document id tag to get the contents of the form field</ul>
  <ul>Remember the "&&" and "||" logical operators! The ternary operator is another option</ul>

<p>7. Write a JavaScript program to determine whether 1st January is a Sunday between 2014 and 2050.</p>

<p id="sundays">Is New Year's Day a Sunday?</p>

<p>This got very overcomplicated! Remember</p>
<ul>You can put the value from a loop straight into the date function e.g. "d = new Date (year,0,1)"</ul>
<ul>You don't need to use a days of the week array, just check whether it's a 0 (0 = Sunday) </ul>

<p>8. Write a JavaScript program where the program takes a random integer between 1 to 10, the user is then prompted to input a guess number. If the user input matches with guess number, the program will display a message "Good Work" otherwise display a message "Not matched". </p>

<button id="userGuess" onclick = "guessNum()">Guess the number!</button>

<p id="guessCheck"></p>

<ul>Woo! That one was faster! Just remember if you've created an id in the js code you need to make sure you've matched it in the html!</ul>

<p>9. Write a JavaScript program to calculate days left until next Christmas.</p>

<p id="xmas"></p>

<ul>
  <li>Ok that was harder than I thought it would be!</li>
  <li>Remember if you want to figure out the number of days in a year you have to start from knowing the number of milliseconds since 1970</li>
  <li>If you want to work out the number of days using milliseconds you have to convert milliseconds into one day like this</li>
  <li>1000 milliseconds (per second) * 60 seconds (per minute) * 60 minutes (per hour) * 24 hours (per day)</li>
  <li>I may be stating the obvious but it's only obvious when you've done it before!</li>
</ul>

<p>10. Write a JavaScript program to calculate multiplication and division of two numbers (input from user). </p>
