  <h1>This is an experimental page to practice JavaScript fundamentals and hopefully get better at it!</h1>

   <p>Exercises from <a href="https://www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-basic-exercises.php" target="_blank">W3 resource </a> </p>
   <p>1. Write a JavaScript program to display the current day and time in the following format.  
    Sample Output : Today is : Tuesday.
    Current time is : 10 PM : 30 : 38</p>

    <p id="exercise1"></p>

    <p> Things to remember about this!</p>
      <ul>Think through converting the hours to 12 hour instead of 24 hour</ul>
      <ul>This array method for selecting a number you don't know: let today = days[date.getDay()];</ul>
      <ul>You need a separate expression to tell midday from midnight or 12 noon will be 0!</ul>

    <p>2. Write a JavaScript program to print the contents of the current window.</p>

    <p id="exercise2"></p>

    <button onclick="window.print()">Print Me</button>

    <ul>You can add a built in method to the html and you don't even have to write a function for it, like this "button onclick="window.print()">Print Me button": </ul>

  <p>3. Write a JavaScript program to get the current date. Expected Output : mm-dd-yyyy, mm/dd/yyyy or dd-mm-yyyy, dd/mm/yyyy</p>

<p id="theDate"></p>

<ul>Remember the months are an array that starts with 0 so you have to add 1!</ul>

<p>4. Write a JavaScript program to find the area of a triangle where lengths of the three of its sides are 5, 6, 7.</p>

<p id="setLengths"></p>

<p>5. Write a JavaScript program to rotate the string 'w3resource' in right direction by periodically removing one letter from the end of the string and attaching it to the front. </p>

<p id="string">W3resource</p>

  <ul>The substring method is a good way to do this</ul>
  <ul>The animation effect is achieved with the setInterval method, each interval replaces the string with the rotated string</ul>

<p>6. Write a JavaScript program to determine whether a given year is a leap year in the Gregorian calendar.</p>

<input type "number" id="year" value="insert year">

<button onclick = "isLeapYear()">Check Leap Year</button>

<p id="answer">Enter a year and click 'Check Leap Year'</p>

  <ul>add ".value" onto the end of your document id tag to get the contents of the form field</ul>
  <ul>Remember the "&&" and "||" logical operators! The ternary operator is another option</ul>

<p>7. Write a JavaScript program to determine whether 1st January is a Sunday between 2014 and 2050.</p>

<p id="sundays">Is New Year's Day a Sunday?</p>

<p>This got very overcomplicated! Remember</p>
<ul>You can put the value from a loop straight into the date function e.g. "d = new Date (year,0,1)"</ul>
<ul>You don't need to use a days of the week array, just check whether it's a 0 (0 = Sunday) </ul>

<p>8. Write a JavaScript program where the program takes a random integer between 1 to 10, the user is then prompted to input a guess number. If the user input matches with guess number, the program will display a message "Good Work" otherwise display a message "Not matched". </p>

<button id="userGuess" onclick = "guessNum()">Guess the number!</button>

<p id="guessCheck"></p>

<ul>Woo! That one was faster! Just remember if you've created an id in the js code you need to make sure you've matched it in the html!</ul>

<p>9. Write a JavaScript program to calculate days left until next Christmas.</p>

<p id="xmas"></p>

<ul>
  <li>Ok that was harder than I thought it would be!</li>
  <li>Remember if you want to figure out the number of days in a year you have to start from knowing the number of milliseconds since 1970</li>
  <li>If you want to work out the number of days using milliseconds you have to convert milliseconds into one day like this</li>
  <li>1000 milliseconds (per second) * 60 seconds (per minute) * 60 minutes (per hour) * 24 hours (per day)</li>
  <li>I may be stating the obvious but it's only obvious when you've done it before!</li>
</ul>

<p>10. Write a JavaScript program to calculate multiplication and division of two numbers (input from user). </p>

<form>
  1st Number : <input type="text" id="firstNumber" /><br>
  2nd Number: <input type="text" id="secondNumber" /><br>
  <input type="button" onClick="multiplyBy()" Value="Multiply" />
  <input type="button" onClick="divideBy()" Value="Divide" />
</form>
  <p>The Result is : <br>
  <span id = "result"></span>
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>There are loads of red squiggly lines on VB Code for this function which made me think it wouldn't work</li>
    <li>In the end I copied it from the JSFiddle answer and it was basically the same as my original code BUT</li>
    <li>I still need to practise talking to the DOM because I couldn't get it to talk to the buttons</li>
  </ul>

  <p>11. Write a JavaScript program to convert temperatures to and from Celsius, Fahrenheit.</p>
  <p>[ Formula : c/5 = (f-32)/9 [ where c = temperature in Celsius and f = temperature in Fahrenheit ]</p>
  <p>Expected Output :  60째C is 140 째F</p>
  <p>45째F is 7.222222222222222째C</p>

  <form>
    Celsius : <input type="text" id="celsius" /><br>
    Fahrenheit : <input type="text" id="fahrenheit" /><br><br>
    <input type="button" onClick="convertCF()" Value="convert Celsius" />
    <input type="button" onClick="convertFC()" Value="convert Fahrenheit"/>
  </form>

  <p id="conversionResult"></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Practice maths! I still don't quite know how to get to the right formula for these answers</li>
    <li>F = c*9/5 + 32</li>
    <li>C = (f-32) * 5/9</li>
  </ul>

  <p>12. Write a JavaScript program to get the website URL (loading page).</p>

  <button id="getPage" onClick="getPage()">Get Page URL</button>
  <p id="pageURL"></p>

  <p>13. Write a JavaScript exercise to create a variable using a user-defined name.</p>

  <form>
    <input type="text" id="userName" value="" />
    <input type="button" onClick="createName()" value="Say hello"/>
  </form>

  <p id="sayHello"></p>

  <ul>
    <li>So the answer to this one didn't help really.</li>
    <li>Remember you can get a value from a field using "document.getElementById("id").value</li>
  </ul>

  <p>14. Write a JavaScript exercise to get the extension of a filename.</p>

  <form>
    <p>Paste your filename here</p><input type="text" id="fileName" value=""/>
    <input type="button" onClick="getExtension()" value="Get extension"/>
  </form>

  <p id="fileExtension"></p>

  <p>15. Write a JavaScript program to get the difference between a given number and 13, if the number is greater than 13 return double the absolute difference.</p>

  <form>
    <input type="number" id="givenNumber" value=""/>
    <input type="button" id="diff" onclick="getResult()" value="get result"/>
  </form>

  <p>The result is <span id="diffResult"></span></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Spent ages trying to figure out why the function wasn't working only to discover I hadn't put the end p tag on</p></li>
    <li>Had to rejig the maths to account for smaller numbers going negative with -13, changed the if statement to avoid that</li>
  </ul>

  <p>16. Write a JavaScript program to compute the sum of the two given integers. If the two values are same, then returns triple their sum. </p>

  <form>
    <input type="number" id="integerA" value=""/>
    <input type="number" id="integerB" value=""/>
    <input type="button" id="computeSum" onClick="computeTriple()" value="get result"/>
  </form>

  <p>These values return <span id="finalSum"></span></p>

  <ul>
    <li>That was much faster!</li>
    <li>There is probably more to figure out with forms and how they work. Added to the list!</li>
  </ul>

  <p>17. Write a JavaScript program to compute the absolute difference between a specified number and 19. Returns triple their absolute difference if the specified number is greater than 19. </p>

  <form>
    <input type="number" id="startNumber" value=""/>
    <input type="button" id="computeNineteen" onClick="diffNineteen ()" value="Compute answer"/>
  </form>

  <p>Your number returns <span id="nineteenAnswer"></span></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Watch out for which variable you return in the final string!</li>
    <li>I've been changing strings and integers because VS Code doesn't seem to like them, although the solutions aren't doing this</li>
    <li>This many exercises in one place is a good lesson in needing to create unique ids in HTML</li>
  </ul>

  <p>18. Write a JavaScript program to check two given numbers and return true if one of the number is 50 or if their sum is 50.</p>

  <form>
    <input type="number" id="qu18numberA" value=""/>
    <input type="number" id="qu18numberB" value=""/>
    <input type="button" id="nineteenSolution" onClick="findFifty ()" value="Can we make 50?"/>
  </form>

  <p id="resultIsFifty"></p>

  <ul>
    <li>I was trying to get the value to return inside the form, but that didn't work</li>
  </ul>

  <p>19. Write a JavaScript program to check whether a given integer is within 20 of 100 or 400. </p>

  <button id="calcTwenty" onClick="enterNumber ()">Click Me</button>

  <p>The answer is <span id="withinTwenty"></span></p>

  <ul>
    <li>That took a long time, not because of the logic but because of getting the HTML to display</li>
    <li>I definitely need to practice maths questions to get a bit less rusty on simplified math logic</li>
    <li>In the end I used a prompt to get the value instead of a form and had to parse the entry to and from a number to get it to return</li>
    <li>I think there is probably a simpler process</li>
  </ul>

  <p>20. Write a JavaScript program to check from two given integers, whether one is positive and another one is negative.</p>

  <form>
    <input type = "number" id="numberOne" value="Enter first number"/>
    <input type = "number" id="numberTwo" value="Enter second number"/>
  </form>

  <button id="checkNumber" onclick="checkPolarity ()">Check numbers</button>

  <p>One positive one negative?</p>

  <p id="checkResult"></p>

  <ul>
    <li>struggling to get negative numbers through the form</li>
    <li>Although I think it might be in my function somehow, but it was working before</li>
    <li>Just figured out I can just do document.getElementById("id").value and don't need .innerHTML :)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>21. Write a JavaScript program to create a new string adding "Py" in front of a given string. If the given string begins with "Py" then return the original string. </p>
